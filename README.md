## es6-browserify-boilerplate
The project contains a boilerplate for ES6 projects.

### Project goal
The main idea is to compile ES6 code using babel, browserify and gulp. The goal is to have a build folder that has simplified structure with one JS, CSS and index.html file.

### Initial setup
```bash
# Clone the repo...
git clone https://github.com/stas-kh/es6-browserify-boilerplate
cd es6-browserify-boilerplate

# Project uses Yarn as package manager, so you have to install it globally
npm install -g yarn

# Then, you should run the following command in your terminal
run-gulp.bat
```
